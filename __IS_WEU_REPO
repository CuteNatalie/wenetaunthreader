__IS_WEU_REPO is a file used in installer.sh https://github.com/w212security/wenetaunthreader/blob/master/installer.sh)
to determine if installer.sh is being run from a downloaded version of the wenetaunthreader repository, or if it is being run
standalone. Currently if you want the installer to pick up on the fact that you have downloaded the wenetaunthreader repository,
you should run it in the same directory as where it is. Example:
if you git cloned or downloaded the zip for wenetaunthreader, and the source is at /var/root/wenetaunthreader/
don't run it from:
  - /
  - /var/root
  - /var/mobile
  - etc.
run it from /var/root/wenetaunthreader.

Similarly, if you want to get the latest version without git pull'ing manually, just remove / rename this file, and it will
clone, despite being run from an existing repository. 

I hope this was helpful.
