# wenetaunthreader
EXPERIMENTAL "untether" for ios 9.2.x (ish) -> 13.5, wen eta jelbrek

Guided Access hack. Passcode must be disabled. :(

## notes
~~this is basically useless without [apatchy](https://www.github.com/spacepilotAV/apatchy), our lightspeed directory patchfinder; but you can use it if you manually create the patches.~~

~~but just wait until the rest of the untether is released, and the guide is as well.~~

Now, apatchy isn't necessary, except with the ~~[legacy](https://github.com/spacepilotAV/wenetaunthreader/tree/legacy) branch~~ legacy is not public, and likely never will be. :\\    not that you would fucking want ***legacy*** \*shakes in fear\*


if you want to try installation using installer.sh (recommended)

* before running, install git. 
* chmod +x before use
* run as root

we're working on a better installer. but, until then, just run installer.sh somewhere on your device with git, and follow the steps. 

## todo

* re-write backbraced in c
* re-write lifesupportd in c
* cleanup code
* get unbanned from discord.gg/jb
