## notes
Firstly.

In the bundle ID field, type "d" if you are using unc0ver installed with a service that keeps the bundle ID.

* list TBD

If you just want to test if your patches work before installing daemons, when asked, do not install daemons.

Then

* test with `enjb && killall -9 backboardd` and `dajb && killall -9 backboardd`
* if satisfied,
* re-install, following the same steps, EXCEPT
* type `y` to install daemons. 

Secondly, 

### NO PASSCODES!!!

This untether does not work with a passcode. DISABLE IT TO USE!
